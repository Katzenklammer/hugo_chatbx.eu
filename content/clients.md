There are [many different clients](https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html) that can be used for XMPP.

We recommend the following, as they all offer the features you would expect from a modern instant messaging client:
* For Windows: [Gajim](gajim.md)
* For Android: [Pix-Art Messenger](https://jabber.pix-art.de/) or [Conversations](https://conversations.im/)
* For Linux: [Dino](https://dino.im/)
* We also have a [web client](web_client.md) for your browser
* You can also use [multiple clients](multi_client.md)
