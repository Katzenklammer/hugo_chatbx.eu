You can easily use multiple clients for the same XMPP account (e.g. one on your laptop and one your mobile phone).

* "Message Archive Management" (MAM) will ensure that all messages are synced to all clients
* "Message Carbons" will ensure that messages are delivered to all clients currently online
* End-to-end encryption with [OMEMO](omemo.md) also easily works in this scenario (see the [tips & tricks](omemo.md#tips--tricks) of OMEMO for proper setup)
