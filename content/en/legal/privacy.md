## This Website

- no tracking tools or cookies used
- we only use TLS encrypted HTTPS connections
- only error logs contain IP address, deleted every 30 days


### Note
Our firewall logs all connection for a very short time period in order to detect attacks. If our firewall detects specific attacks, it will save this logs which contains the following information:
IP Address, used Browser, connection Time, used OS, the whole content of a request.
Those logs are stored until they are no longer needed for legal steps or security improvements. 

## XMPP Server

- we only store the following data that you provide:
	- username (may be a pseudonym)
	- password (hash)
	- stored messages (MAM) - if enabled
	- uploaded files (photos) for 30 days
- **you can always delete your account which will deletes all of your stored data** - Maybe some uploaded images will stay up to 30 days. 
- we do not analyze any metadata (e.g. message timestamps)
- we only share data with others in accordance with the XMPP protocol (e.g. when you send messages to other servers)
- we recommend end-to-end encryption so that it is impossible for anyone else (even for our administration crew) to read your message content
- we only use TLS encrypted XMPP connections
- the logs contain IP addresses, connection times, and user names. There is no fixed period of time of log clearing. They will be deleted if they reach a specific time. 

### Note
It is hard for us to detect spam which is invoked from another XMPP server. We do not analyse any traffic (not even for this). If you encounter spam, please get in contact with us: `admin@chatbx.eu`.
