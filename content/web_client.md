We have a web-client that allows you to chat in your browser: https://web.chatbx.eu/

* The web-client uses [Converse.js](https://conversejs.org/)
* Just log in with your username (without the `@chatbx.eu`) and password from your registration
* We recommend to disable the "This is a trusted device" checkbox, as otherwise a new [OMEMO](omemo.md) key will be generated and added to your account
