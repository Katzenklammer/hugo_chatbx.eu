This is a brief guide on how to setup an account and start to chat. Want to know what this is all about? [Read about XMPP](/documentation/xmpp).

1. Register a new account at: https://accounts.chatbx.eu/
	- Note: Your JID ("Jabber ID") will be your username, followed by `@chatbx.eu` (e.g. `alice@chatbx.eu`)
2. Install a [client](/documentation/clients)
	- Note: You can also use [multiple clients](/documentation/multi_client)
3. Start client and log in with credentials from account registration
4. Add your contacts to your "roster" (this is your contacts/friends list)
	- this sends a request to see their status (online/offline) and allows them to see yours
	- you can also chat with people that are not in your roster
5. Chat with your contacts
6. Optional: Activate [end-to-end encryption](/documentation/omemo) to secure your messages
