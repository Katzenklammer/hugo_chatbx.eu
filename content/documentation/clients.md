There are [many different clients](https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html) that can be used for XMPP.

We recommend the following, as they all offer the features you would expect from a modern instant messaging client:
- For Windows: [Gajim](/documentation/gajim)
- For Android: [Pix-Art Messenger](https://jabber.pix-art.de/) or [Conversations](https://conversations.im/)
- For Linux: [Dino](https://dino.im/)
- We also have a [web client](/documentation/web_client) for your browser
- You can also use [multiple clients](/documentation/multi_client)
